# Puissance 4 (Connect Four) - Mastercamp Data Science Python Workshop

This project implements a complete Connect Four (Puissance 4) game in Python, featuring both human and AI players. The AI uses advanced techniques such as Minimax with alpha-beta pruning, transposition tables, and killer move heuristics to play competitively.

## Purpose

The code is part of our Mastercamp in Data Science Python workshop. It serves as a practical exercise in:
- Game state modeling and manipulation
- Implementing and optimizing AI algorithms
- Applying Python programming best practices

## Features

- Play Connect Four against the AI or watch two AIs play against each other
- Efficient board representation and move validation
- AI with Minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and optimizations for fast decision-making
- Modular code structure for easy extension and testing

## Team

This project was developed by a team of three students:
- Maxime Musquin
- Paul Pelletier
- Camille Oden

## How to Use

1. Run `main.py` to play the game or watch AI vs AI.
2. Run `tests.py` to simulate multiple AI games and evaluate performance.

## Files

- `main.py`: Main entry point for playing the game
- `board.py`: Board representation and utility functions
- `ia.py`: AI logic and decision-making
- `tests.py`: Automated tests and simulations
